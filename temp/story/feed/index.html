<span id="more-4343"></span></p>
<h4>The Challenge</h4>
<p>For 30 years, the International Community Foundation (ICF) has served an important role as a philanthropic leader in the San Diego/Tijuana border region. In November of 2018, more than 5,000 Central American migrants arrived in the border city of Tijuana, marking the beginning of an ongoing humanitarian and human rights challenge.</p>
<p>The lack of infrastructure needed to shelter such a large group of people led to public health concerns, as weather conditions worsened and cases of illness among children were confirmed by binational health officials. This is the situation that thousands of people found themselves in, fleeing violence or persecution and running out of resources before securing a chance at asylum.</p>
<h4>The Solution</h4>
<p>Through Ana Lorena, we were able to engage many Latin American celebrities such as Jaime Camil, Bruno Bichir, Daniel Habif, among others, who called their supporters to action that day. TV personality and singer Larry Hernandez posted a video urging fans to do their part in assisting migrants, resulting in 87,000 views and a large increase in traffic to the GlobalGiving platform.</p>
<h4>The Result</h4>
<p>The overarching goal of these resources will be to support Tijuana in addressing the humanitarian needs of migrants through the assistance of grassroots organizations that are focused on capacity building, convening, and infrastructure development.</p>
